# Eye Movement Exercise
Creates the image of two eyes and causes both eyeballs to move within the eye in sync with movement of the mouse.  Just move
the mouse around the page and watch the eyeballs move.

Possible future improvements include adding a button which when pressed, toggles opening and closing of eyes.  Another button
could control dilation of pupil, which is often done for eye examinations.
